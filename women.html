    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Sally</td>
    <td>Girl Called Sally</td>
    <td>Main narrative woman</td>
    <td>Sally is the central figure of the track, first encountered on the street. Rizzio is drawn to her confidence and presence, yet keeps emotional distance. She represents the archetype of the elusive, self‑possessed woman who disrupts his usual bravado. Their dynamic is flirtation mixed with tension, setting the tone for her later reappearance.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Sally</td>
    <td>Motorway Man</td>
    <td>Recognized woman from past encounter</td>
    <td>Reappears unexpectedly in an alley confrontation. Rizzio adopts a lawyer persona, exposing resentment and unresolved desire. She becomes a symbol of the one woman who unsettles his ego. Her presence in this track shows continuity in his mythic universe: she is the rare figure who crosses regional boundaries and narrative arcs.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>May</td>
    <td>Brand New Player</td>
    <td>Weekly companion</td>
    <td>Monday-night partner who indulges Rizzio’s appetite and rhythm. Their relationship is transactional, playful, and physical. She represents routine pleasure and the comfort of predictable desire.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Fay</td>
    <td>Brand New Player</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Pam</td>
    <td>Motorway Man</td>
    <td>Regional encounter</td>
    <td>From Birmingham; part of Rizzio’s motorway circuit. Their interaction is casual and physical, reflecting his nomadic, conquest‑driven persona. She represents the regional archetype: a stop on his emotional map rather than a lasting connection.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Jacka</td>
    <td>Motorway Man</td>
    <td>Old party friend</td>

    <td>My Missus</td>
    <td>Past lover</td>
    <td>Nagging and dissatisfied, she challenges Rizzio’s ego. She symbolizes conflict and incompatibility, a reminder of mismatched expectations.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Miss Take</td>
    <td>My Missus</td>
    <td>Past lover</td>
    <td>Greedy and demanding; the “whole cake” metaphor shows how she consumed more than the relationship could sustain. She represents overindulgence and regret.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Miss Adventurous</td>
    <td>My Missus</td>
    <td>Past lover</td>
    <td>Despite her name, she is boring in bed. She symbolizes unmet expectations and the gap between fantasy and reality.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Miss Understanding</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Miss Conduct</td>
    <td>My Missus</td>
    <td>Past lover</td>

    <td>Ruth</td>
    <td>Big Booty Bitches, Slutty Slags and Horny Hoes</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Little Miss Bo Peep</td>
    <td>Wanton Streak</td>
    <td>Metaphorical figure</td>
    <td>A symbolic inversion of the nursery rhyme. She represents innocence corrupted, aligning with the track’s playful, transgressive tone.</td>

    <td>(Bristol City’s lady)</td>
    <td>Cummin' Round Her Mountain</td>
    <td>Game show contestant</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Ruth</td>
    <td>Aroundaway</td>
    <td>Past partner</td>
    <td>Referenced again as someone who thought she was “all that.” She represents ego clashes and the women Rizzio dismisses after the fact.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Beatrice</td>
