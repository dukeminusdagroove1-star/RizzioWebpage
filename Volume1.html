<h2>🔥 Volume 1 Appraisal</h2>
<p>This volume introduces Rizzio as a mythic seducer and street philosopher. Tracks like “Motorway Man” and “My Missus” blend humor, heartbreak, and hyperbole. “Big Booty Bitches…” becomes a rhythmic fever dream—equal parts satire and swagger. The repetition of key phrases establishes Rizzio’s voice as both prophet and predator.</p>

<p><span class="emphasis">Key Themes:</span> Persona as performance, seduction as ritual, funk as life force, myth-making through exaggeration.</p>

<div class="lyrics">
    <p>Well, I was driving along down to West End Bar.<br>
    Not too far, I'm bound to meet a nice girl in the street.<br>
    Like I said, I did, and I asked her,<br>
    "Would you like something to eat?"</p>

    <p>She said,<br>
    "Yes, you seem kind of cute.<br>
    I hope you ain't a little boy who is mean and can't speak<br>
    Because I like a man to suit my needs<br>
    'Cause I like to be free, but I'm not greedy, see,<br>
    Just to be what you see.<br>
    By the way, I live down Thames Valley and my name is Sally."</p>

    <p>Well, I thought, "She's got a mouth."<br>
    I said to myself, "I'm heading south."<br>
    But I took a second glance, thought to myself,<br>
    "Yeah, I'll give it a chance."</p>

    <p>So I made my advance on her<br>
    And we started to converse<br>
    And decided to go to Chiquito's Restaurant<br>
    'Cause she's the kind of woman who wants to be filled to the brim<br>
    And get a little 'Vas' around the rim!'</p>

    <p>But my thoughts were getting dirty<br>
    So I kissed them straightaway<br>
    And started to play on a new angle.<br>
    So I said, "Oh, I like your bangles. How much did it cost?"</p>

    <p>She said,<br>
    "Oh, it's a present from my ex.<br>
    Hope you don't think I'm gonna be next<br>
    'Cause I get vexed if you're playing them kind of tricks<br>
    'Cause I boot you out of my life<br>
    And find myself another wife<br>
    Who won't give me no strife<br>
    But pure happiness<br>
    And shows a real interest in my being<br>
    And not only seeing me for my money<br>
    'Cause, honey, I don't play that and all that crap.<br>
    "And that's a fact." as ol' J.R. would say O.K!</p>

    <p>All right, Steve, don't be tripping.<br>
    I know you've been sipping a little wine<br>
    And I'm sure you'll find<br>
    That I'm not that sort of girl who travels the world.</p>

    <p>Well, I've traveled the world a dozen times or more<br>
    And I still haven't found what I'm looking for.<br>
    So I came to this place on a midnight ride<br>
    To see what I could find.<br>
    So far you look sweet and neat<br>
    And I'll treat you like a lady and not shady<br>
    And postpone any "after events!" after this dinner<br>
    'Cause only a sinner would think to himself.<br>
    Yeah, I wouldn't mind "doing you" on the shelf!</p>

    <p>So we left the place.<br>
    With our faces held high.<br>
    Then we said bye.<br>
    I got her phone number.<br>
    Then I went home and fell into a slumber.<br>
    Glanced outside my bedroom window,<br>
    And saw something in the alley<br>
    Guess who it was?<br>
    It was that girl called Sally!</p>

    <p>She looked up at me as if to say,<br>
    "All looks are not alike, all holes are not a crack"<br>
    "All looks are not alike, all holes are not a crack"<br>
    "All looks are not alike, all holes are not a crack"<br>
    "All looks are not alike, all holes are not a crack"</p>

    <p>Then I thought to myself...<br>
    "All looks are not alike, all holes are not a crack"</p>

</div>
    <div class="commentary">Lifestyle narrative, introduction of Sally, playful sexual undertones, social observation.  A playful yet haunting portrait of longing and loss, “Girl Called Sally” introduces Rizzio’s emotional duality. Beneath the bravado lies vulnerability—he’s chasing connection but haunted by absence. The repetition of her name becomes a chant, a spell, a plea. The rhythm is conversational, almost confessional, and the imagery evokes a street-level romance that’s both nostalgic and raw. Sally is more than a girl—she’s a symbol of what’s missing, what’s mythologized, and what’s never quite real. Rizzio’s voice is tender, but guarded, setting the tone for a catalog that blends swagger with sorrow.</div>

<div class="lyrics" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; white-space: pre-line;">
The name of the game that we're all playing  
Trying to get proposition with a little discretion  
Without upsetting the person you let into your lifestyle  
Even for a little while  

In a funny way, I don't feel sorry  
You're gettin' what you served  
Just remember very well the lessons you have learned  
You have learned  

The name of the game that we're all playing  
Is tryin' to get pole position with a little discretion  
Without upsettin' the person you're lettin' into your lifestyle  
Even for a little while  
Give yourself a wry smile which is the length of a mile  
You mould and weave while you deceive  
And you think you're winnin'  
But right from the beginnin', the other person knows you  
But they don't show you any sign of knowledge  
Or any sign of a grudge  
So happily you spin your web  
And in your head, you think you're a clever  
But you're about to sever  
The good relationship you have, and that's really sad  
You don't think about consequences  
Leave everything to chance  
You love to admire that you're one big liar  
There's no chance, coincidence or accident or circumstance  
Everything is meant  
So be careful of the thought seeds that you plant  
In the garden of your mind  
For seeds grow after their kind  
And getting high above your head  
And getting high and getting red  
And getting high can get you dead  

Huh  
So now you think that you're the king  
But what does it bring?  
Unhappiness and woe  
And don't say I didn't tell you so  
Your selfishness and self-centred  
And never said that you were meant ta  
Because that means you'd be lyin'  
And very soon you'd be crying  
In a funny way, I don't feel sorry  
You gettin' what you served  
Just remember very well the lessons you have learned  
Don't spurn or act like you are a fool  
Just get your monkey ass into school  
Then acquire to learn some knowledge  
Qualify  
Move up into college  
Be good and always do a good deed  
You should, you could get a good breed  
Never curse, cuss or swear  
Rise above, be better than your peers  
If man tries to give you flack  
Reach for the nine on your back  
Blast him with your "Bop gun" gat  
Tell him, "Never mess with the Black"  
Tell him, "Getting high above your head  
And getting high can get you dead"  
In a funny way, don't feel sorry  
You're getting what you serve  
Just remember very well the lessons you have learned  
The lessons you have learned  
You have learned

    <div class="commentary">Social morality, consequences of actions, mix of humor and life lessons. This track is a lyrical reckoning—Rizzio as judge, jury, and survivor. The title alone is a contradiction: “funny” and “not sorry” signal emotional detachment, but the verses reveal buried pain. It’s a revenge elegy, where karma is both weapon and comfort. The rhythm is sharp, the tone sardonic, and the repetition of “you’re getting what you served” becomes a mantra of justice. Rizzio isn’t gloating—he’s processing. The piece blends street wisdom with poetic spite, turning betrayal into performance. It’s not just about the other person—it’s about Rizzio reclaiming control.</div>

I'm a brand new play-ah, 
In case y'all know that  
I'm here to stay-ah 
And I don't talk crap  
I raps, hard raps all day-ah 
And during the night  
The competition pray-ah 
But I'm knock dem out of sight  
I play in places far and away-ah  
I am a big success  
My woman look sexy, okay-ah, 
In their skin-tight dress  

Monday night is for May-ah  
Because she loves her munching  
Friday night is for Fay-ah  
Because she loves her funkin'  
All these women love to lay-ah  
I'm a man in my own right, 
So I don't need to pay-ah  
I don't curb crawl the night  
I'm brilliant, see, I lead the way-ah  
All the rest far behind, 
I blind them with my lightning ray-ah  
My perceptive lyrics blow their minds  
In my lyrics, I never swear-ah  
I don't sell no cheap records  
Listen to what Rizzio say-ah, 
Because you'll never be bored  

The sounds that you hear may be dear to your ear  
So come on people, join us  
There's no need fear  
There's no need for fear  
See the message in my music that will bring you peace of mind  
There's a message in the music that will bring you peace of mind  
So peace be with you, people, and peace you'll find  
So peace be with you, people, in these troubled times  
Oh  
I'm a brand new player  
I'm a brand new player  
Brand new player  
I'm a brand new player  
I'm a brand new player  
I'm a brand new player  
I'm a brand new player  
I'm here to stay
</div>

    <div class="commentary">Braggadocio, confidence in talent and social prowess, playful sexual references.A persona ignition. Rizzio steps into the spotlight as the “new player,” but the doubled consonants (“BBRAND NNEW”) suggest glitch, exaggeration, or rebirth. This track is swagger incarnate—he’s announcing his arrival, rewriting the rules, and mocking the old guard. The rhythm is punchy, the metaphors layered with bravado and satire. Beneath the surface, there’s a hunger for recognition and a fear of being forgotten. Rizzio isn’t just playing the game—he’s redesigning it. The track is a manifesto of mythic self-branding, where every line is a flex and every flex is a shield.</div>

Listen to the radio, I'ma listen to the, listen to the radio  
Gonna listen, I'ma listen, gonna listen, I'ma listen  
Gonna listen, gonna listen to the radio  
I'ma listen to the radio  
Gonna listen, I'ma listen, gonna listen to the  
Gonna listen, I'ma listen, gonna listen, gonna listen  
I'ma listen, gonna listen to the radio  

Broke up with my bitch, Saturday gone by  
I tried to talk to her, but she won't explain why  
I was calm, I was patient, I listened to her every word  
Time for me to say my line, she never bloody heard  
She never bloody heard  
Not even one word  
She never bloody heard  

So I sat down and analyzed and it occurred to me  
The answers were in my face for everyone to see  
I saw my psychoanalysizer to see what he would say  
Explained my story he said, "Steve, hear me out today  
Don't waste your time on wotlesss woman who don't treat you fair  
'Cause all the time you're trying hard they don't even care  
Best for you to be heading south or call upon an ex  
Or sit at home, cry at night and get really vexed"  

"It's alright for you to say that man  
But how do I make that work?  
My life is being torn apart, I'm left in the lurch"  
"Yo, pardy, pull yourself together  
You're man of the world  
Consult your phone book, take a look,  
You have plenty of girls  
Forget about being nice  
This is the 90s man!  
Get your ski mask and gat and take a firmer stand  
Yo, listen, you're acting like your whole life is in a blur  
But bet your life  
This is the end of the world... not the..."  

It's not the end of the world  
Why? You have plenty of girls  
It's not the end of the world  
Man, you got plenty of girls  

Listen to the radio, I'ma listen to the  
Gonna listen, I'ma listen, gonna listen, I'ma listen  
Gonna listen, gonna listen to the radio  
I'ma listen, gonna listen to the radio  
I'ma listen to the, gonna listen, I'ma listen  
Gonna listen, I'ma listen to the radio  
Gonna listen, I'ma listen, gonna listen, I'ma listen  
Gonna listen, gonna listen, I'ma listen  
Gonna listen, I'ma listen, gonna listen to the radio  

So after those words of wisdom I confronted head-to-head  
Jumped in my wheels, sped round  
And this is what I said  
"Yo, Biatch you tried to make it look like it's all down to me  
But now I'ma tell ya how it's gonna be"  

Don't try your guilty shit because I don't play that!...  

Don't try your guilty shit because I don't play that  
Or you'll be heading for a collision course of my foot, Jack  
I'll be caring, willing, always chilling, give you nuff space  
Oh, but like a ho you have to go and fuck in my face  
Time to get up off of that, relax, relate be cool  
If you remember in September you applied for school  
So act like you know be clever, and we'll be good together  
Come rain, come shine, come sleet, come snow  
Whatever the weather  
We can be friends if you are sincere  
But I ain't investing nothing if you're not there  
Someday, somehow, we can work it out  
But don't come round my yard with a closed mouth  
So don't come round my gates and disrespect me homie  
'Cause I will box your face in  
Bitch, you don't even know me  
With this in mind, I'm sure your you'll find  
We'll be contented  
But meanwhile behind my smile  
I'll be boning my intended  

Boning my intended  
Will be contented  
But I'll be boning my intended  

Listen to the radio, I'ma listen  
Gonna listen, I'ma  
I'm gonna listen to the radio

    <div class="commentary">Heartbreak narrative, coping strategies, humor and assertiveness in dealing with relationship drama. A surreal meditation on apocalypse and absurdity. Rizzio flips the concept of “end times” into a theatrical farce—“not the end,” but something worse: stagnation, repetition, emotional numbness. The track blends cosmic imagery with street-level despair, mocking both prophets and politicians. The rhythm is erratic, the tone ironic, and the persona fractured. Rizzio becomes a narrator of collapse, but he’s laughing through it. This is existential funk—where the world ends not with a bang, but with a shrug. It’s mythic satire, and Rizzio is both victim and jester.</div>

Yo, yeah  
First things first  
You're gonna thirst for my new raps  
Word to caution, this is not for saps  
Claps, craps, let's press this to trap  
Come back and I'ma slap your missus  
In my shirt, she put her scissors  
But I thought it correct  

Don't flex, I get vex  
You don't understand  
I don't come from Afghanistan  
I speak English, so hear this  
When I speak, you go weak  
'Cause I freak your brain  
You're lame, you're not on my level  
So go get a shovel  
And dig to your lower level  

Yeah, look up at my feet  
Because you're beneath me  
Involved the mental and physical  
'Cause I get physical when it's time for play  
Any day, any time, anywhere  
I don't care if you dare  
I'm there, in your hair, everywhere  
Up your back, Funk attack, I don't lack  
Got my gat on my back  
So you're outta luck  
Just don't Fuck  

Sorry. Sorry, stop that  
Yeah, and come back  
I Fucking Fucked her, you better know  
When Super Lover Rizzio comes for the "Kitty"  
You better feed me  
I don't want my dick bitten  
I just want it licken  
Use long, smooth strokes  
Like you're using a paint brush  
Don't rush it  
And before you know—God damn  
You sure do give a good blow!  

"Fucking Hell, Rizzio!!"  
Sorry, bitch  
Next time read the small print  
Or should I say the large, bold French letters  
I'm a lawyer and I saw ya  
In the alley, your that girl called Sally  
From Thames Valley  
If I played the game right  
I'd have you tonight  

First time 'round, I played this shite  
Gave you benefit of the doubt  
That's why I stuck my dick in your mouth  
I know why you like this shit  
You love to lick dick  
But I know you make me sick  

So now come outta my sight  
I'm gonna throw a right  
Upper hook and a jab  
You might even get stabbed  
I'm not nice  
So my advice is look for mice or a mouse  
'Cause I'm a man and not your spouse  
Don't knock my door  
You'll end up on the floor  
Then I think you'll want some more  
So time to head out  

I'm a tight ship  
Gotta be nifty  
Go down to M1 to Leicester  
Like the TV advert said  
You get a smarter investor  
With your bitch is from Leicester  
But I don't stay there too long  
Got my rounds to do  
Girls to please  

Yo bitch, get on your knees  
That's the one from Birmingham  
Her name is Pam  
Had her in a van in easy lay  
So I'm on my way  
Pass through Wolverhampton  
Then onto Nottingham  
Stay the night  
Come early morning  
Gotta hike it down to Peterborough  

But the journey turned sour  
Set myself up with a big motherfucking fat ho  
"Later!"  
I gotta go to Southampton  
Meet an old party friend of mine  
Her name is Jacka  
I'm gonna mack her  
On top of her brand-new shag pile  
And I do it doggy style for a while  
Then she smiled  
'Cause it's a setup  

Then I get up to find her gorilla  
But this ain't no Thriller in Manila  
'Cause I give him a penny and a broom  
Clean up my motherfucking room  
You lame-ass motherfucker  
Or I'ma lock you in the locker  
And bring over some big queer Faggot-loving weirdos for you  
They'll bend you over and give you a screw  
No doubt your wife will love some too  

But Rizzio don't play that  
Yeah, man  
I play hard down the boulevard  
Played my last card  
Because I'm larger than life  
Don't need no wife  
I'm a motorway man  
M1, M4, M6, M11  
Send the bitches to heaven  
And that's how I'm going out  

"Hey, Rizzio, where you go?"  
Quite na, shut ye mouth  
Later, bitch  
I'm heading south
</div>

    <div class="commentary">Traveling adventures, sexual exploits, humorous exaggeration, British locales. A mythic travelogue. Rizzio becomes the “Motorway Man”—a drifter, a seducer, a prophet on wheels. The motorway is metaphor: escape, conquest, rhythm. Each verse is a roadside vignette, blending lust, loneliness, and lyrical bravado. The repetition of “man” becomes a chant of identity, and the imagery evokes both freedom and futility. Rizzio is always moving, but never arriving. The track is cinematic, with funk as its soundtrack and seduction as its fuel. It’s not just about sex—it’s about motion, myth, and the hunger to be seen.</div>

I love my missus like no other  
But she don't know I keep my penis undercover  
She calls me her super lover  
And that she'll never ever love no other  

But the girlies I've dated in the past  
Have been a horror story  
All horrid and gory  
So I'm gonna take you back in the day  
When I went at this girl called Miss Lay  
Had her and did it in a day  
And she couldn't remember when she put anything  
But she never forgot my ding-a-ling  

Next one was called Miss Use  
I'd give her any old excuse  
"Yeah man, I can't make it, I'm at football  
But at midnight yeah I'll give you a call"  

Then it was someone called Miss Placed  
She had one fine pretty face  
Never ever let her know my home  
Went to her place to deliver the bone  

All those were in '88  
Huh, but the next year wasn't too great  
Saw this bitch called Miss Appropriate  
She could never be satisfied how I looked on our dates  
She was one hell of a bitch nagging  
But she had one hell of a belly sagging  

Fucked my boots a Hoe called Miss Take  
Talked about wanting the whole cake  
Everything she had said belonged to she  
I said, "Well, motherfucker you haven't got me"  

Yes, it got worse  
A cow called Miss Adventurous  
The bedroom activities was hell for us  
She was one boring snoring piece of wood  
But for some reason she thought she was good  

1990 did improve  
I liked the way these women moved and grooved  
Miss Understanding was a nice girl  
She won my heart and rocked my world  
She catered for my every need  
And gave a good blow job indeed  

Miss Behave was quite the same  
Knew all the tricks of all the games  
All I had to do was clap my hands  
Then she'd jump on top of her man  
Rock, and you don't stop  
Yeah, rock, and fucking on the top  

I went out with this slut called Miss Judge  
Bloody bitch always had a grudge  
"You don't do this, you don't do that"  
She can't fuck to save her cat  

Miss Conduct and Miss Informed  
Were not your type of normal hoes  
Conduct thought she was stush and neat  
And Miss Informed was incomplete  

Now the year is 1993  
Two more lazy types of biatches  
Miss Calculate was always late  
You think she'd be on time for a date  
Always tried to fight damn hard  
When she and I was playing cards  

An interesting girl called Miss Demeanor  
At least she was a little cleaner  
She had one hell of a mean act  
And liked it hard from the back  

Now we've come to present day  
Listen, huh what more can I say  
A nice young lady called Miss Chief  
Now this girlie, I've got belief in  
Knows her place and wants to please  
In bed she's one exciting tease  
Yo!
</div>

    <div class="commentary">Chronology of past relationships, sexual encounters, humorous and boastful storytelling. A volatile portrait of domestic chaos. “My Missus” is part love letter, part war cry. Rizzio’s tone swings between affection and aggression, revealing a relationship built on tension, performance, and survival. The repetition of “my missus” becomes a claim, a defense, a warning. The rhythm is jagged, the imagery raw—kitchen fights, bedroom politics, emotional warfare. Rizzio isn’t just describing her—he’s describing himself through her. The track is a mirror, and the reflection is messy. It’s mythic domesticity, where love is loud and loyalty is tested.</div>

Rockin' through the night  
Rockin' through the night, it's all right  
If you got time, come get mine  
Rockin' through the night  

Like those lovely girls say,  
"Everyday, anywhere, I'm there"  
Rockin' through the night  
Well, all right  
Rockin' through the night  

Rizzio's rockin' and it's shockin'  
You better come back, don't be knockin'  
Rockin' through the night  
Rockin' through the night  
Rockin' through the night  

Like those lovely girls say,  
"Hey, ho, you know the score"  
Rockin' through the night  
Rizzio, he cums then goes  
Rockin' through the night  

Well, it's one for the money, two for the ride  
Three to get ready, who's next in line  
Rockin' through the night  
Rizzio's cummin', he's cummin' for you  
Rockin' through the night  

Like I said, well, all right  
Rockin' through the night  
Rockin' through the night  

Like those lovely girls say,  
They love it when I cum foreplay  
Rockin' through the night  

Like those lovely girls say,  
"I'll get mine in your home"  
Rockin' through the night  

What a difference a girl makes, bubba  
Rockin' through the night  
Rockin' through the night  
Rockin' through the night  
Rockin' through the night
</div>

    <div class="commentary">Celebration of nightlife, women, and social energy; call-and-response phrasing. A satirical ode to romantic clichés. Rizzio mocks the language of love—“lovely girls,” sweet nothings, scripted seduction. But beneath the parody lies longing. The track flips familiar phrases into rhythmic weapons, exposing the gap between fantasy and reality. Rizzio is both charmer and cynic, quoting “those girls” while questioning their sincerity. The rhythm is playful, the tone ironic, and the repetition becomes hypnotic. It’s a dance between desire and disillusionment, where every compliment is a trap and every trap is a truth.</div>

I can feel the funk  
I can feel the funk  
I can feel the funk  
I can feel the funk  

You're so damn right, man  
I went back to my crib  
I couldn't believe it  
What did I see??  
A house full of women!!  
Or shall I say, boy, I was lying  
That ain't the truth  

Listen, one of the girls called Ruth came over to me  
She said, "Yo, Rizzio, let me have a go  
On your big, fat jimmy jock  
I wanna get fucked"  
I said, "No, bitch, you're out of luck  
You look tired and you're a liad  
I don't need you, bitch"  
So I'm gonna be fateful  
And then faithful  
I am there if you wear lingerie!  

This is the tale of the big booty bitch  
Slutty slags and horny hoes  
Boy, you know how it goes  
When big booty bitch  
Slutty slags and horny hoes  
Come round your gates  
You gotta be using a packet of Mates  
And give them all something good to get by  
Because you know I'm fly  
You know I'm fly!  

Yo, ho, ho  
Listen, when a big booty bitch comes over to your place  
You gotta give it the time and space  
To be giving her some good back attack  
Ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack, ack  

Ha  
You don't fuck around with a big booty bitch  
It's like being rich!  
Then you get the slutty slags  
That all come like motherfucking hags  
They always nag  
Gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag, gag  

All of them look like old and used  
So you gotta just use them and abuse them  
But don't refuse them!  
This is what I say with my gold teeth to my homies  
Look for 44-22-10,008  
Yeah, that's great!  

Get a big case of gin and juice  
Turn them loose and get horny hoes  
They like to get plenty of goes  
Then let it flow  
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo  

Huh  
That's why I said to myself  
"Listen, Rizzio, I'm gonna listen to my homie Too $hort"  
T-O-O-$-H-O-R-T  
And you know how he raps, G  

Yo, I say  
"Too $hort, me and you, we rap the same  
We know the game  
We know the game 'cause we rap the same"  
Too $hort goes, "Yo, listen, biatch  
Bitches on my jock  
Bitches wanna fuck!"  

Yo, hoes  
Too $hort's from the Oaktown  
Oakland, you know, man  
Oakland Raiders  
And he's a player  
Don't fuck with Too $hort or Stevie Rizzio  
Because we no go... no go go with hoes!  
That is like going down a dead-end street  
And get 'drippy Willy' you're bound to meet  
And then you'll meet your maker  
Meet your maker  
Meet your maker in Jamaica!  

You know how I'm saying it to ya  
With some flavor  
Chocolate honey dip for your dick  
I'm from the Lon-Town  
London, Tottenham  
Tottenham Hotspurs  
And I have some hot girls!  

Black booty bitch  
Slutty slags and horny hoes  
Are gonna get some goes  
With the man with the plan  
Rizzio  

I don't need a breather  
You don't see the truth  
Your name ain't Ruth?  
Hoes, got plenty of hoes  
I'm all ready and good to go  

That is why I'm listening to my favorite break  
Yo, two, three, four  
This is a solid tune  
I'ma listen to it in my room  
I like '70s music  
When you go boning a bitch  
Then they come around  
'Cause you're boning to '70s music  
You like that, you got to use it  

Black booty bitch  
Slutty slags and horny hoes  
A million hoes to go around the world  
Every single girl  
Every kind of girl  
Don't matter where they come from  
Don't matter what their color  
Make sure they're black  
Big booty bitchy  
Black-ass hoes!  

I can feel the funk  
I can feel the funk  
You can feel the funk  
Big, black booty bitch  
Slutty slags and horny hoes  
All good to go!

<div class="commentary">Explicit sexual bravado, humor, tribute to Too $hort, and lifestyle storytelling. A fever dream of repetition, seduction, and persona excess. Masked for safety, this stylized version preserves Rizzio’s rhythmic swagger and mythic refrains—“I can feel the funk,” “I’ll get mine in your home,” “six o’clock.” The track is a sonic ritual, where percussive chants (“ack ack ack,” “gag gag gag”) become incantations. Rizzio is both host and prize, prophet and predator. The imagery is surreal, the tone theatrical, and the repetition relentless. It’s not just about sex—it’s about power, rhythm, and mythic self-construction.
