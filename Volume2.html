<h2>🔥 Volume 2 Appraisal</h2>
<p>Rizzio fractures and multiplies. He becomes a game show host (“Cummin’ Round Her Mountain”), a late-night predator (“Dirty Old Man in a Raincoat”), and a backdoor philosopher (“AroundDaWay”). “Six O’Clock” visualizes disappointment, while “Wanton Streak” flips nursery rhymes into surreal, sexual parables.</p>

<p><span class="emphasis">Key Devices:</span> Refrains as ritual, persona layering, satirical inversion of pop culture, funk as ideology.</p>

Yeah<br>
Just chilling out here<br>
Got enough clout<br>
Coming back to attack, yo<br>
Got no gats on my back<br>
Rizzio don't need no gats<br>
He comes back and attacks from the back<br>
<br>
I'm a quarterback<br>
Throw a missle<br>
Or a bomb<br>
You know where I'm coming from<br>
The lung town<br>
And I come back in your home<br>
'Cause I'll get mine in your home<br>
<br>
That's my concept<br>
My concept is conceptual<br>
The Con stands for when I come down to your gates<br>
I will trick you<br>
I will lick you<br>
Then I will de-dress you<br>
<br>
I'm coming round for one thing, girl<br>
I'm coming round to mingle if I decide to<br>
I'm not here to misguide you<br>
The conceptual part of it is this<br>
Yo, this is how it go<br>
I'm coming round to give you a bone<br>
I'm coming round<br>
I'll get mine in your home<br>
<br>
You can never come to my digs<br>
Don't must ever figure out where my whereabouts are<br>
Rizzio's in the laid-back kick<br>
Gonna be kicking out beats on the streets<br>
Rizzio don't come from the old school or the new school<br>
He comes and he rules<br>
He rules his own patch<br>
<br>
Come back<br>
Come back with your bad self<br>
Rizzio, take it slow<br>
Take it easy<br>
Easy-peasy<br>
I eat rice and peas and it pleases me<br>
'Cause the food gets me in the mood<br>
<br>
Home<br>
'Cause I'm coming round to give you a bone<br>
I'll get mine in your home<br>
I'm coming round 'cause you feel alone<br>
I'll get mine in your home<br>
I'm coming round 'cause you rang my phone<br>
I'll get mine in your home<br>
I'm coming round 'cause I like to hear you moan and groan<br>
I'll get mine in your home<br>
I'll get mine in your home<br>
I'll get mine in your home<br>
I'll get mine in your own home<br>
I will get mine in your own home<br>
I'll get mine in your home<br>
I'll get mine in your home

    <div class="commentary">Sexual exploits, Sir Rizz persona, playful dominance in romantic encounters. This track is a conceptual seduction ritual. Rizzio becomes a quarterback of desire, attacking from the back with swagger and rhythm. The repetition of “I’ll get mine in your home” is both literal and mythic—he’s invading emotional space, not just physical. The verses blend bravado with vulnerability, revealing a man who performs dominance to mask isolation. Food, funk, and flirtation become metaphors for control. Rizzio’s persona fractures into host, prophet, and predator. The rhythm is hypnotic, the imagery surreal, and the emotional core is raw: he wants connection, but only on his terms.</div>

I tell you, boy<br>
This is true<br>
I was feeling blue 'til you came through<br>
My life was going nowhere<br>
But now you're here<br>
I truly care about your welfare<br>
<br>
Life was boring<br>
And I was ignoring<br>
All of the other sucker MCs<br>
You gotta believe that you're a revelation<br>
The only one in the nation<br>
Who gets me elevated<br>
<br>
The music you've created<br>
With a mixture of funk and jazz<br>
Has got that pizzazz<br>
The vocals crunching and unorthodox<br>
Pumping music on my box<br>
Makes me feel like sunshine<br>
And it takes my mind off to another place<br>
<br>
Your raps soothe my brain<br>
Those perceptive lyrics are original<br>
That's why you're so cool and sweet<br>
Sweet to the beat<br>
"Well, I try to do a good deed!"<br>
<br>
Oh, Rizzio!, Rizzio!, you're born to mack<br>
"Oh yeah, you're right about that!"<br>
Oh, Rizzio!, Rizzio!, you make me flow<br>
"Well, if you say so!"<br>
<br>
I'm just here being myself<br>
Don't care about anyone else<br>
I put my energies in me<br>
Fuck other G's, bitches and hustlers<br>
That's why you love me like you do<br>
<br>
I'm afraid you're not the only one<br>
But I've got time if you've got fun<br>
I'm an extremely busy, man<br>
I spread my love around, around, all over town<br>
But if you can get with the program<br>
I'd love to oblige you, ma'am!<br>
<br>
Oh, Rizzio!, Rizzio!<br>
You just seem to know the right words to say<br>
On my bed, I'm gonna lay<br>
Just come 'round if you have time<br>
You are always, always on my mind<br>
And on my friends' minds, too<br>
We want to be groupies for your crew!<br>
<br>
We're glad you're here<br>
"Fuck y'all, bitch, I'm everywhere!<br>
I touch women all over the land<br>
I also touch them with my hands<br>
Please partake on leaving your digits<br>
And I'll call you when I want a fidget!"<br>
<br>
Oh, Rizzio!, Rizzio!<br>
Please promise to take it slow<br>
I'll wait for you anywhere<br>
I'm so glad that you're here<br>
Where have you been all my life?<br>
I'm sure that you do need a wife<br>
I would do anything for you<br>
And a little extra for your crew<br>
<br>
"Huh, there you have it, y'all<br>
I don't brag on myself<br>
Self-praise is no praise<br>
I'm coming now to amaze you<br>
Don't matter one, two, three or four zone<br>
I'll get mine in your home<br>
Huh<br>
<br>
'Cause all I want is a quickie<br>
Make it quick, make it slick<br>
Gotta do it right, gotta do it all night<br>
Make it happy, make it snappy<br>
Make it quick, lickety-split<br>
Gotta do it right, don't take all night<br>
<br>
Lickety-split<br>
Yo, ho, make it quick, yeah<br>
Make it quick, yeah<br>
Lickety-split<br>
Gotta do it right, don't take all night!"

    <div class="commentary">Fan admiration, musical impact, elevated moods from Rizzio’s artistry. This track functions as both invitation and performance, situating Rizzio as a charismatic orchestrator of social and sexual dynamics. The repeated refrain, “We’re glad you’re here,” frames a communal, almost ritualistic space where female presence validates his persona. Rizzio’s tone mixes charm, humor, and subtle assertion of control, highlighting the interplay between admiration and power. Lyrically, the women act as catalysts—both audience and participant—reflecting his need for recognition and narrative reinforcement. Musically, syncopated funk rhythms mirror the playful tension between flirtation and dominance, emphasizing ritualized seduction while sustaining the anthology’s layered mythos.</div>

5:59, it's about that time. I gotta get mine.<br>
A homie of mine had something lined up for me<br>
'Cause I'm feeling desperate, see.<br>
Been on a drought , can't get about,<br>
So he suggested he'll set me up.<br>
For what? I don't know.<br>
But I know I got to go for a date and it's getting late.<br>
But my nervous system is telling my brain to listen,<br>
To forget this mission.<br>
I'm seeing a vision that this girl may be ugly,<br>
But my homie says "No way, G!<br>
Take it from me, you gotta believe<br>
You're gonna be in Heaven, and your lucky number's 7!"<br>
Well, I hope so. So I'll go with the flow.<br>
The deal is that I gotta wear something red.<br>
She'll recognize, look in my eyes<br>
And see if I'm a nice guy.<br>
If not, she'll walk right by.<br>
But she better be worth it,<br>
'Cause I ain't down for no shit.<br>
<br>
I want a queen on a throne<br>
So I can get mine and yo' home.<br>
Went down to the meeting place,<br>
Looked in the store window to check my face.<br>
No spots or pimples, so I look simply fine.<br>
It's 5:59, so I'm on time.<br>
Then this bitch came up to me and asked,<br>
"Is your name Steve?"<br>
I scoped her body up and down.<br>
I will never take this bitch on the town.<br>
Ugly mug, no chest and no back.<br>
None outta ten, this bitch did lack.<br>
Huh. Whoa.<br>
<br>
This was one motherfucking set-up.<br>
The bitch I will never fuck.<br>
That cow has gotta body like six o'clock.<br>
Talk about my lucky number being 7...<br>
It should've been 5!<br>
Huh. She would've had chest and back, yeah.<br>
Whoa. I can get with that.<br>
<br>
Fucking hell.<br>
Trust it to be 6 o'clock.
</span>

    <div class="commentary">Date story, humor in expectations versus reality, casual sexual themes. A visual metaphor for disappointment and setup gone wrong. “Six o’clock” becomes a symbol of flatness—no chest, no back, no curve, no thrill. Rizzio’s lyrical voice is bitter, sarcastic, and self-aware. He’s been duped, and the track becomes a cautionary tale wrapped in bravado. The repetition of time—“5:59,” “lucky number 7,” “should’ve been 5”—creates tension and rhythm. This isn’t just about a bad date—it’s about expectations, ego, and the myth of seduction. Rizzio is both victim and narrator, turning humiliation into performance. The funk is subdued, the tone theatrical, and the persona cracked.</div>

Destruction, corruption, deception, misconception.<br>
No order, move over. Four leaf clover, don't bother.<br>

I'm blessed, I'm dressed to the 9's.<br>
Lucky number's 7 or is it 5?<br>
Chest and back, back attack from the mack.<br>
I'm not Scottish, got a fetish<br>
For Stacked, Blacked, Backed walking pieces of art.<br>
Make mine a half Olde English for the homies.<br>
A few drops for the cronies, the wino's<br>
I knows 'cause I knows where the nose goes,<br>
When the door's closed, where we suppose,<br>
And the girls pose<br>
Fake the funk and your nose grows.<br>
Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk<br>
Laying him down to sleep.<br>
He's shagin' by the heap.<br>

On a wanton streak.<br>
Little Miss Bo Peep hoeing industry.<br>
Wanton streak.<br>

A wee diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle.<br>
That's a diddle, the cat riddled.<br>
Made a puddle in the muddle.<br>
The cow (not my girl!) jumped over the moon<br>
As soon as the tide came in.<br>
Waves in, tides out. Oi, shut your mouth!<br>
The little dog laughed too see such fun.<br>
Because the moon went in and out came the sun.<br>
So I'll wake up and get out. Got my girl Scout.<br>
Homies on my side, we glide in stride.<br>
We bonafide and we gonna bone some hide.<br>
I'm on the prowl, I'm gonna growl.<br>
I'm looking for a beautiful gal.<br>
I'm not looking for matrimony,<br>
I'm looking for mattress-mony!<br>
Got the dread grooves and moves.<br>
Horizontal on the frontal.<br>
Hide the bones so the little dog didn't laugh anymore.<br>
Kicked him out the door and the dish ran away with the spoon.<br>
Fruit of the Loom T-shirt is what I wear with my 70s flairs.<br>
Three inches above my feet.<br>
Against the wall, I'm gonna take a leak.<br>

<br>
On a motherfuckin' wanton streak.<br>
And I'm a motherfuckin' freak of the week.<br>
Wanton streak.<br>
<br>
Verse three, I'm gonna curse.<br>
Wanton streak is good when it's bad<br>
And bad when it's good.<br>
This is not a theory, so hear me.<br>
So when I put it in layman's terms,<br>
So you can and your friends will learn, confirm...<br>
Nasty is nasty, all looks are not alike.<br>
All holes are not a crack.<br>
I'll give a hoe nuff flack.<br>
But that don't mean I don't like her.<br>
It means I despise her<br>
'Cause everything I say, I mean the opposite.<br>
Opposites attract, that's why I hate the front and do it from the back<br>
'cause the back is stacked and I don't lack.<br>
If you're having fun, I'm on the one.<br>
And if you have 2, you're lucky<br>
'Cause you'll get plenty of fucks 'G'<br>
Everything is in haphazardous oder order.<br>
And I told you, you comprehend my friend,<br>
Nothing is good unless you play with it.<br>
And all that is good as you should know<br>
Should be nasty and not last, see<br>
For if you can free your mind, your ass will follow.<br>
Freedom is the state of mind<br>
And then the condition and position of your ass.<br>
So if you will suck my soul<br>
I will lick your funky emotions two times,<br>
One good and one bad.<br>
But I promise I will do you no harm.<br>
<br>
I'm on a wanton streak. Tell ya.<br>
Wanton streak, on a motherfuckin' wanton streak.<br>
I'm a freak of the week.<br>
On a motherfuckin' wanton streak.<br>
Rizzio goes where the nose goes, with the doors closed 'Cause he knows where he goes, when he scores.<br>
Wanton streak.<br>
Freak of the week.<br>
On a wanton streak.<br>
Yo. Please no.<br>
Wanton streak.<br>
Yeah, freak of the week on a wanton streak.<br>
I'm a freak of the week on a wanton streak.<br>
I'm a freak of the week on a wanton streak.

    <div class="commentary">Sexual freedom, playful humor, repeated refrains to emphasize Sir Rizz’s persona. A surreal, sexually charged fever dream. Rizzio flips nursery rhymes into mythic parables—“Bo Peep hoeing industry,” “dish ran away with the spoon.” The repetition of “wanton streak” and “freak of the week” becomes a rhythmic chant, a persona invocation. The track blends satire, seduction, and social critique, mocking romantic ideals while celebrating raw desire. Rizzio is philosophical here, riffing on freedom, opposites, and emotional contradiction. The rhythm is erratic, the imagery layered, and the tone unapologetic. It’s not just about lust—it’s about chaos, contradiction, and the mythic power of funk.</div>

Riding two white horses when I come<br>
Cummin' round the mountain when I come<br>
Riding two black bitches when I c—ha—ha—ah—mm.<br>
Ooh. Ah, ha, ha. Ooh. Yeah.

    <div class="commentary">Game-show style sexual escapades, audience engagement, playful rhyming. Rizzio becomes a game show host of seduction, blending bravado with absurdity. The repetition of “Cummin’ round the mountain” is both sexual and theatrical—he’s riding horses, hosting contests, and offering himself as the prize. The track mocks romantic clichés, flips gender roles, and turns conquest into entertainment. Rizzio is playful, provocative, and self-aware. The rhythm is bouncy, the tone satirical, and the persona exaggerated. Beneath the humor lies commentary on performance, masculinity, and desire. It’s not just a sex anthem—it’s a mythic broadcast.</div>

Rrrrraaaahhhhhhhhh!!<br>
<br>
I'm bored oh Lord<br>
In this life you can't afford to be low you know<br>
So get high and fly<br>
Like Lucy in the sky<br>
And you'll get by<br>
It's one of those days<br>
I'm afraid my mind to belong to me you see<br>
It's my Alter Ego<br>
And he go where he go<br>
He can't be controlled<br>
He can't be told<br>
He told me that he is in a "Dirty old man in a raincoat mood"<br>
In layman's terms that ain't good<br>
It's nasty believe me<br>
Thinking of things that can never be aired<br>
Or declared I fear the systems appear<br>
Somewhere around midnight<br>
When there's nothing to do<br>
Nowhere to go all alone at home<br>
So you get your phone book and then take a look<br>
At all the possible girls<br>
Who wants their worlds rocked<br>
And maybe you might be in luck<br>
By the end of the night you'll get your fuck<br>
So give 'em a call but don't stall<br>
Get straight to the point<br>
Make sure you got plenty of joints<br>
And make your way to their abode<br>
Tell 'em that it's bijou<br>
And they'll be glad to see you<br>
Probably cook you up some food<br>
But they don't know<br>
That i'm in a dirty old man in a raincoat mood<br>
It's all good!!<br>

    <div class="commentary">Alter ego persona, sexual humor, late-night adventures. An alter ego emerges—Rizzio as late-night predator, driven by boredom and lust. The “dirty old man” is a mood, a mask, a warning. The track explores isolation, fantasy, and the rituals of seduction. Phonebooks, joints, and midnight missions become symbols of desperation. The rhythm is slow, the tone confessional, and the imagery raw. Rizzio isn’t glorifying this persona—he’s exposing it. The raincoat is both costume and shield, and the mood is dangerous. This is mythic vulnerability disguised as sleaze, where loneliness becomes performance.</div>

<pre style="font-family: Arial; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Maybe your baby or maybe you're lady, 
Drive you crazy all day.  
Best thing to do is step through to the new for you.  
Forget feeling blue and get into the red.  
It's a far better bet.  
Get stoned and get a bone from around the way.  
Less hassle per day and better by the pound.  
I found that there's no allegiance to the latter,  
No pitter-patter of tiny feet 
Or taking the bitch out on the street.  
It's the pure dread groove horizontal,  
On the frontal or behind or whatever your inclined is.  
But don't miss out on that happy nappy  
Or be scared of the girl's pappy,  
'cause I gets mine behind closed doors.  
I'm a backdoor man.  
You know what he said,  
"No pass, no backstage head."  
Yeah. I'm like that coming hard 
I drive a '64', No an '8'8' 
Telling pure lies is my disguise  
Because Rizzio transforms into Sir Rizz, 
The man with the charisma.  
He'll go far anytime there's a girl to scout.  
Like football managers, I get my boys to check 'em out.  
Then, I size them up, they're prey, and weigh it up, 
Give 'em a fuck.  
It's all okay because I get mine around the way.  

Part two, yeah, I'm still coming through.  
Round her mountain and still scouting.  
I got your back and I slap ma'fuckers like in my last raps 
So you better listen up 'cause when I fill up my cup,  
It's 100% proof.  
Knock your head on the roof.  
I like getting high above my head.  
I like getting high and getting red.  
And that's the truth, just ask my bitch Ruth 
She thought she was all that but I knew deep down she wasn't bad.  
But she gave it a good try so I sat by and let her have it.  
My dick that is, from the alias man, Sir Rizz.  
Knighted her in Sir Rizz fashion,  
She knelt before me and kissed it with so much passion.  
Lots of jumpin' jack hammer action.  
Look up over at the clock.  
It's late, so I knew I was running out of "Fuck" 
'cause I got a date elsewhere, so i'm mo tear it up here 
And then head out.  
Like I said, I got me girls to scout.  
That's for later 'cause I got a greater rendezvous.  
I'm meeting my Nigga P.H. 2  
Acid on the Richter scale, in colour he's red.  
Fuck around with us, man, and you end up dead.  
Partners from way back when in the day, 
We always get ours from around the way.  

Yeah. It's always good around the way  
because you wanting everything.  
They, everything run you  
because we de-around good all, always it's.  
It's always good around the way  
because you wanting everything.  
They, everything run you  
because we de-around good all, always it's.  

Yeah. You know how it goes and that's what it's all about.  
Yeah, 'cause Rizzio ain't fuckin' around  
because it's his last track on Cummin' Round Her Mountain.  
When I come, always getting booty humping.  
When I come, Cummin' Round Her Mountain when I come  
because I'm cummin' around the way.  
Every day it's all good, like I said,  
'cause you wanting every day.  
Every day Cummin' Round Her Mountain
It's always good around the way  
because you wanting every day.  
They, everything run you  
because we de-around good all, it's always it's.  

Rizzio and I gotta go.  

I don't want you to go.  
You can't leave.  
You can't leave me no more.  
Ooh. Baby.  
Hey, baby.  
Girl, I'll see you on the bright side.  
And I'll squeeze you and make you my girl.  
You will be my girl.  
Girl, I'm gonna love you much.  
And I will never let you go.  
Ooh, baby.  
Ooh, baby.  
Everybody knows the trouble we see together or later.  
Girl, I'll see you on the bright side, yeah.  
Girl, I'm gonna love you much.  
I'm gonna make you my,  
I'm gonna squeeze you and make you my girl.

    <div class="commentary">Backdoor man theme, scouting women, social commentary, sexual exploits. Rizzio becomes the “backdoor man”—a scout, a strategist, a seducer. The track blends street wisdom with sexual philosophy, mocking romantic norms and celebrating raw desire. “Around the way” becomes a mantra of freedom, movement, and conquest. Sir Rizz emerges here—charismatic, calculating, and mythic. The rhythm is slick, the tone confident, and the imagery cinematic. Football managers, aliases, and scouting rituals create a layered persona. This isn’t just about sex—it’s about control, charisma, and catalog-building. Rizzio is everywhere, and he always gets his.</div>
