<h2>🔥 Volume 3 Appraisal</h2>
<p>This is Rizzio at full power. “Desperate Times” and “C Da Real” confront systemic injustice with lyrical fire. “Know the Game” is a metaphor-laced masterclass. “Playtime” and “U Get Me” blend seduction with surrealism. “Bangin’” and “You’re Goin’ Down You Slagg” close the trilogy with lyrical warfare and persona crescendo.</p>

<p><span class="emphasis">Key Evolutions:</span> Funk becomes prophecy, persona becomes weapon, wordplay becomes warfare, the myth becomes self-aware.</p>

<hr>

<h2>🧠 THE ARTIST: STEVEN / RIZZIO</h2>
<p><em>Catalog-builder. Myth-maker. Tactician.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="emphasis">Mythic Swagger:</span> Prophet of funk, host of seduction, quarterback of conceptual conquest</li>
<li><span class="emphasis">Rhythmic Ritual:</span> Repetition as incantation (“I’ll get mine in your home,” “six o’clock”)</li>
<li><span class="emphasis">Emotional Duality:</span> Bravado masking desperation and hunger for meaning</li>
<li><span class="emphasis">Linguistic Acrobatics:</span> Wordplay, surreal metaphors, rhyme flips</li>

With your more dangerous minds. I'm Michelle Pfeiffer.<br>
With a star they come bite like piper<br>

Damn shame. Who next?<br>
Many souls broke me arrest.<br>
But me vex and me stress.<br>
Have me getting up me chest.<br>
So me do what me do what me do best.<br>
Just kick rhymes for the bye. Rhymes for the bet.<br>
One time for the street, two times for the hedge.<br>
Three times for the &lt;&lt; do you wanna tease people?<br>

Hearing live from the devil.<br>

Nobody talk about breed up inside time that me clean up.<br>
Stop rapping for free. Look after my family.<br>
What? Me telling you for real, certain man must feel the steal.<br>
Heal me completely. Let me see my face on TV.<br>
Screaming "Don't leave me on the street"<br>
Because life ain't easy.<br>
My chest is getting wheezy.<br>
Carbon pollution try for tease me.<br>
Criminals try for thief me<br>
But me ready to achieve see.<br>
I'm hotter than your baddest boy under the sun.<br>

Now me feel my time has come, must make money, plenty sums.<br>
So if you're with it rude boy let me see you grab your rum<br>
And drink to better days.<br>
These desperate times so I'll be done.<br>
<br>
Desperate times.<br>
Money spenders. <br>
Trying to hurt me. <br>
Big time lenders. <br>
In my Prime<br>
World Title Contenders. <br>
Ain't going down. <br>
Bludclart fakers. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
Rough necks. Rude boys. <br>
Gangsters, hustlers. <br>
Trying to hurt me. <br>
Low life scum. <br>
In my prime<br>
Ain't going down. <br>
Yeah. Hits and hits comes. <br>
<br>
Deranged minds doing desperate crimes <br>
In order to keep your head above the dirty water. <br>
People walking round and round with frown <br>
Slowly drowning in the Lon-town. <br>
Hoes on street corners in Stamford Hill. <br>
Cars crawl by like marauders looking for the kill. <br>
These are the last days and times. <br>
These are the fuck me desperate times.<br>
<br>
Butane gas froze at minus seventeen,<br>
Enabled me to crack the d-lock on the bike<br>
Located at the scene of the crime. <br>
+17's the digit. <br>
Sights obscure so I bulldoze the midget. <br>
Caught up and bagged up by the team. <br>
Locked in a cell, moons out, thej udge is looking green. <br>
Similar to the giant that we know. <br>
My barrister represented so had to let me go.<br>
<br>
That's a joke. <br>
How can a man have hope <br>
And may as well keep smoking the fucking dope? <br>
Some say you're wasting your time, Rizzio, <br>
But these are desperate times my bro.<br>
<br>
Released on conditional bail not to visit complicity. <br>
My wife ain't the funk, you may as well see the cemetery <br>
'Cause breath and a body don't exist without cash. <br>
Dip the ash, run out once again make the illegal stash.<br>
<br>
She should know better 'cause he's under enough pressure. <br>
It's a man with a stressor, leave the house and undress her <br>
Emotionally but she making the most money. <br>
She talking to the brother like retarded black dummy. <br>
The problem compound when him start kicking her down <br>
Like a rag doll being slaughtered, hung, drawn and quartered. <br>
The courts are black and lawless <br>
As the minutes curtail, the moral issue prevail. <br>
Desperate time led you to jail.<br>
<br>
From Vegas to London. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
Criminal schemes get corporate funding. <br>
Trying to hurt me. <br>
You know them rich people are laughing. <br>
In my prime. <br>
While the poor people are starving. <br>
Ain't going down. <br>
And it's causing insanity. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
Depravity with mortality. <br>
Trying to hurt me. <br>
And then the blood clot worried about me showing up.<br>
<br>
In my prime. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
Trying to hurt me. <br>
In my prime. <br>
Ain't going down. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
Trying to hurt me. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
In my prime. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
Ain't going down. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
Desperate times. <br>
Desperation all around. <br>
I ain't going down. <br>
Ain't going down. <br>
I ain't going down. <br>
Ain't going down.<br>
</span>
    <div class="commentary">Commentary on urban survival, crime, and desperation in London. A street elegy wrapped in funk. Rizzio narrates systemic decay—Stamford Hill becomes a war zone, and hope is a joke. The repetition of “desperate times” becomes a dirge, a warning, a mantra. He’s not just describing the streets—he’s surviving them. The tone is bitter, the rhythm slow-burning, and the imagery stark. Rizzio’s voice is prophetic, blending despair with defiance. This isn’t just social commentary—it’s mythic testimony. He’s documenting collapse, but refusing to drown. The track is raw, rhythmic, and emotionally charged—a lyrical broadcast from the edge.</div>

You got to know the game that you're playing.<br>
On these rough ghetto streets.<br>
You got to know the game that you're playing.<br>
Life's getting kind of deep.<br>
<br>
I had my bets every day in this city, frantic.<br>
Mad rush, straight flush with a touch of Atlantic.<br>
Soul mates flipping coins, jagged edges like stone.<br>
My man, ace of spades. Shady Grove club, you've known.<br>
That countless faith, ready to roam, mobile phone chrome.<br>
Courtier in my views than Concorde planes.<br>
Stars, this suit fit like new.<br>
Black presidents, mad representing.<br>
Stocks, my full house residence.<br>
Professor is my evidence to domino your win.<br>
In the games of death, my roulette tends to spin.<br>
In from right to left, unquenchable thirst.<br>
More rum and drinks spiking, unmentionable girls.<br>
But three big diamonds for four black tarts.<br>
'Cause two fit gyal and I'm here to start.<br>
Blackjack on the run, he couldn't find him no funds.<br>
His business going under, the dealers start to plunder.<br>
Speculate the crack before the lightning come the thunder.<br>
He didn't double or quit with the craps on strike.<br>
"Gotta get me a knife." Cut his hopes with a switch.<br>
From fucked up and poor, twist to stinking rich.<br>
This bitch of a life, dealing cards with lay no blame.<br>
Just laying lucky ladies like Brack, I call no name.<br>
Check the hand that I'm holding. It's wicked and honest.<br>
Like newborn babies abandoned daily in forests.<br>
<br>
You got to know the game that you're playing.<br>
On these rough ghetto streets.<br>
You got to know the game that you're playing.<br>
Life's getting kind of deep.<br>
<br>
You couldn't deal with my ace, queen, joker, or jack.<br>
I left out the king 'cause I'm heading up the pack.<br>
My shit's fat like Joe, Heavy D, or B-I-G.<br>
I get cash like coin op slot machines.<br>
A show girl shaking her shit in Las Vegas.<br>
Illegit but that's what the world made us.<br>
Candy layouts on a quest to make papes.<br>
Put high risks on high chips for high stakes.<br>
For high loot to give to my troops.<br>
While petty criminals continue with your trivial pursuits.<br>
I got a cert on the 2:40 at Tottenham.<br>
It's the thoroughbred gyal with the big fat bottom.<br>
Bigger than Papa, so the size you can guess.<br>
Won't come a cropper in a game that I play best.<br>
It's spinning you like a jenny when I groove ya.<br>
So crank it up, sit on it, girl, and let it move ya.<br>
I wanna prove that I'm Black, good over the tracks.<br>
No, not JR, but I got 10-gallon raps now.<br>
'Cause I got the path for this.<br>
Like the '68 Olympics with a Panther fist.<br>
I want C-O-D, no I.O.U.s.<br>
I want currency longer than lottery queues.<br>
Whether it's cash on a deck, credit cards that flex.<br>
Or seven-figure plus account paychecks.<br>
<br>
You got to know the game that you're playing.<br>
On these rough ghetto streets.<br>
<br>
B-I-T, where my C-H at?<br>
Centered to the game, sparks off chips and stacks<br>
Picked up for a pound, frown, trained for 27 days<br>
Hitting decks, walking tarmac to gain rep<br>
Producing paper that warfare's based on<br>
Covering the round table to claim the gross sums<br>
Channeled through the right direction.<br>
Acknowledged by the fattest erections.<br>
Spread my profession when my bank balances injecting<br>
Investment from one pound to a Merc<br>
Yard, it brought Gods and Ninja killing bodyguards.<br>
Keep the Queen close to your chest.<br>
Trust not even yourself as deadly venom never rest<br>
Seeking out those with slick Ericsson phones<br>
Fuckin' gangster suits that could never be cloned<br>
Walk side-by-side the bank injections<br>
Staying incognito 'cause starting revelation<br>
Can lead to mass mutations<br>
Decease sublime with no peace of mind<br>
As you forfeit your right to quick elimination of card crimes<br>
That's my Queen, aka notorious money-grabbing fiend<br>
She'll stay...<br>
<br>
Ha ha ha!<br>
I got more metaphors than Blackadder<br>
Leavin' you cold, wet-drained from the bladder<br>
Innuendos, innu-out-dos<br>
The I knows and the you knows<br>
Similes, silly fleas all in the circus<br>
The man riddles roulettes, no less, alas!<br>
Cashing bets<br>
I play in-laws, outlaws, in every game I claim four<br>
Everythin' from twos to aces<br>
In all of Atfrantic City's gambling places<br>
<br>
The joker's wild, unique oblique style<br>
Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm<br>
Girls, cars, cash, money, I got piles<br>
But you gotta watch your back<br>
I got the black pack, watchin' mine<br>
Intruders will try and come and steal yours<br>
Know the game, game the know<br>
Words and hindsight from Sir Rizz alias Rizzio<br>
Your Highness<br>
The game, the what, why, when, where, what, who?<br>
Work it out people, it's all within you<br>
<br>
You got to know the game that you're playing.<br>
On these rough ghetto streets.<br>
You got to know the game that you're playing.<br>
Life, life getting kind of deep.<br>
</span>

    <div class="commentary">Life lessons, street smarts, gambling metaphors, wisdom from Sir Rizz. A metaphor-laced masterclass. Rizzio becomes strategist, prophet, and lyrical gambler. The track is dense with wordplay—“innu-out-dos,” “Blackadder,” “roulettes”—each line a flex and a warning. He’s not just playing the game—he’s rewriting it. The repetition of “know the game” becomes a chant of survival and self-awareness. Rizzio’s persona is regal here—“Your Highness,” “Sir Rizz”—but the wisdom is street-born. The rhythm is slick, the tone confident, and the message clear: if you don’t know the game, you’ll lose. It’s mythic mentorship, where every metaphor is a move.</div>

To the card sharp shuffling.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
The rude boy snuffling.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
To all the brothers who can't think without a drink.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
Those locked up inside the clink.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
<br>
Who the hell can stand this flow? Act like you know.<br>
But fools looking for gold at the end of rainbows.<br>
Yo, too slow my friend. I shift gear like Mercedes-Benz.<br>
Sentiment for skunk on the streets making ends.<br>
<br>
What a difference a day makes, no longer smoking "Fags"<br>
Selling square deals through the transparent bags.<br>
I'm the Wizard of Oz, I get my cake and eat it.<br>
Shit so good, other dealers can't beat it.<br>
This is gonna be great, yeah, I mean it.<br>
Get him high in Dalston like the ex-Chancellor Lawson's<br>
<br>
Budgets are low, so your lips are smudge it.<br>
Like Stamford Hill holes, most breeders won't touch it.<br>
As long as they know I'm like Firing on the Mike,<br>
'Cause I use my MC skill to set the spliffs alight,<br>
Ignite the chalice, like a relaxer burns fro.<br>
Busting Babylon like a pimp slaps hoes,<br>
I rose above my foes because I'm born to be king.<br>
Getting paid like Don, not dead like Martin.<br>
I'm starting, just like a pistol from Bristol.<br>
Reel you in like an angling times issue.<br>
<br>
To the bitches and backside ladies.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
To the hoes gold digging for Mercedes.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
To all the down low creepers.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
To the punnies popping like tweeters.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
<br>
It takes different strokes for different folks.<br>
What are you talking about, Rizzio?<br>
MCs who can't flow, should know fuckin' better.<br>
No blanks in my Beretta.<br>
Please excuse my French letters.<br>
<br>
Trends, I'm a setter.<br>
Capital gains, write my letter.<br>
Head's sending insane because nobody does it better.<br>
Like James Bonds, Thunderball, that Henry Kutcher bring me.<br>
Watch me inject Octopussy.<br>
<br>
Enough rappers like to bang on about hollow tips.<br>
This rapper likes to jiggle tits and tickle clits<br>
So I don't have the clips of Capone imitators.<br>
But I freak more clique than Ann Summers vibrators.<br>
<br>
Like sexy airline hostess simulators.<br>
MCs ain't getting sex too many masturbators.<br>
Keep it real every time, like me a man in my prime.<br>
Suspects in a case like vintage vineyard wine.<br>
<br>
Crime Watch UK, that's where you teeth rappers stay, for real.<br>
No license to grab mic, we're phone steel.<br>
The limelight just like Princess Diana.<br>
You stupid fuck like Tony Montana.<br>
<br>
Fuck Santana, and Harvey Keitel's piano.<br>
<br>
My old 1980 hit by Ross, Diana.<br>
I like getting high, inhaling the vapor.<br>
When I'm with my girl smoking da Rizla paper.<br>
<br>
To the pistol packing posse.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
Soft MCs like toffee.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
The wannabe Sicilians.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
Men marching about a million.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
<br>
My facial expression gets more screwed than pro's.<br>
Send them more messages than m-m-Morse code.<br>
To all the so-called real rugged and raw<br>
Who bought a Fugees album but still don't know the score.<br>
<br>
You know aggression rules making many fools<br>
They go through regression schools<br>
Trying to rewrite the rules.<br>
Bullshit counselling taught by I.C.1's,<br>
Because they're the motherfuckers who are having all the fun.<br>
They call us I.C.3, but that don't matter to me.<br>
It's just another fancy way of saying Nigga G.<br>
<br>
You see, catch a pop gat, strap on gats, here's a trap door.<br>
Heard it all before. Boy, me ready to snow.<br>
That's right. You got me sleeping, son,<br>
'Cause your gat was once a gun. Plow.<br>
That's how the west was won.<br>
Black cowboys had no fun.<br>
Life was choking.<br>
Now your ass is getting broke in.<br>
No mystery to solve, penal systems, ain't no joking.<br>
Bomb notes, lazy players must get heckled.<br>
I walk the streets of Tottenham, niggas want to test my mettle.<br>
Let's settle the score like Shaft in Africa.<br>
Give me three sexy wives and some MCs to massacre.<br>
<br>
I asked you, what's black, white, and red all over?<br>
A brother covered by a sheet shot by a revolver.<br>
So point your pistols in the right direction.<br>
See the real like a 60 millimeter projection.<br>
<br>
To all the bent coppers.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
To the black life droppers.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
To the Kerb-crawling judges.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>
To the courts with the grudges.<br>
I'll make you see the real.<br>

    <div class="commentary">Social commentary, musical style, life lessons, honesty in urban life. Rizzio becomes a lyrical truth-teller, exposing systemic injustice with fire and funk. The repetition of “I’ll make you see the real” is both threat and promise. He calls out bent coppers, kerb-crawling judges, and racial coding (“IC3”) with precision. The rhythm is relentless, the tone confrontational, and the imagery vivid. Rizzio blends street slang with poetic critique, turning every verse into a weapon. This is not just rap—it’s resistance. The track is a manifesto of survival, identity, and lyrical power. Rizzio is no longer just a player—he’s a prophet.</div>

Playtime, mad money on my mind.<br>
I want the ladies, Mercedes, the weed and the wine.<br>
Playtime, mad money on my mind.<br>
I want the girls with the pearls, black diamonds, they shine.<br>
<br>
You know our motto is to get 'em horizontal.<br>
So ladies, drop panties for any of the crew they want to.<br>
Nut spots suck 'em, slam bones kinda often.<br>
Have you forgotten? I'm also dirty rotten plus a scoundrel.<br>
So cheat and lie, yes I'm bound to.<br>
And do I not move and ride your horse when I'm around too.<br>
But this one's going the full twelve, at my nine and it's poontang,<br>
The pontoon that I yell.<br>
I hit it like a gat, rat-a-tat-splat,<br>
When I unload the clip of my sexual MAC.<br>
Tap-tap, who's there? Projects, that's my crew.<br>
What you wanna do next? Knock the boots.<br>
That's the cue for my pair of eight to get between her.<br>
What's love got to do with it? In the words of Tina Tina,<br>
Backwards misdemeanors, it's what I do best.<br>
Next to putting white spots all over her chess board, I don't think so.<br>
Claw like a seagull when I hit the equivalent of eighteen in golf.<br>
So now you know my name, you know my game, you know my crew.<br>
We might throw in, knock the boot, because that's what we've come to do.<br>
<br>
Playtime, mad money on my mind.<br>
I want the ladies, Mercedes, the weed and the wine.<br>
Playtime, mad money on my mind.<br>
I want the girls with the pearls, black diamonds, they shine.<br>
<br>
You get the booty prize, girl, for opening up my eyes.<br>
Surprised the way you were stacked, for real, the pick of the pack.<br>
And I ain't talking no crap, straight A's is beating your slack.<br>
Dirty jokes for little dicks rolling dice, go for hits.<br>
I like the shape of your tits, elating rear like a pier. Uh.<br>
If I don't win tonight, the price of diamonds getting dearer.<br>
I'm wide like that joker's winning streak in the clubs.<br>
Poppy foots cost a wallet, heavier than reggae dubs.<br>
Lioness, you need to feed, I got no problems with greed.<br>
You can bring the weed and I will come with the seed.<br>
Bleed them suckers dry. Watch the king of hearts cry<br>
Because I'm teaching the queen poker,<br>
As I reveal your body face, beauty backside and your bust.<br>
Now you're over 21, so in these figures I trust.<br>
38, 23, 41, confess.<br>
I ain't no mathematician but your digits represent.<br>
Unlike you played-out hustlers, trying to look up her dress.<br>
Here's a word of advice, I keep my cards close to her chest.<br>
We play together, whatever the game, she's undressed.<br>
So get on with your bad self, it's good for my health.<br>
You go, girl!<br>
<br>
Playtime, mad money on my mind.<br>
I want the ladies, Mercedes, the weed and the wine.<br>
Playtime, mad money on my mind.<br>
I want the girls with the pearls, black diamonds, they shine.<br>
<br>
Won't you come on down to my playground?<br>
I got pleasurable rides for you to get on down.<br>
Frowns not allowed and banned in here.<br>
No need to fear my dear, I say this very clear.<br>
Progressing, undressing, baby oil caressin' your body.<br>
Having you here is like a party.<br>
Moving, grooving, to the slow soothing.<br>
The music is rare and I wind in your groove.<br>
And smell the sweet perfume from your glands ooze.<br>
Water of life, the sweet nectar juice.<br>
Time is ready, head to the land of plenty.<br>
"Anchors away, Cap'n to the shores of Ol' Blighty"<br>
You won't be thinkin' of England when I get into you now.<br>
More like heaven, then times it by 7!<br>
Lucky number for most but not for your host.<br>
5 is my number 'cause it's like an "S"<br>
That shapes a fit woman in a tight mini dress.<br>
She put her hand down my trousers and played with my dice.<br>
She rolled 'em and stroked 'em like two little mice.<br>
I said, "What's the score?" She said, "It's 5 + 1"<br>
I didn't waste no time, man, the game had begun.<br>
We had "Six" all night, I played a five card trick.<br>
The king and the queen in the playtime scene.<br>
I'm getting raw, rough, rugged and mean.<br>
<br>
Playtime, mad money on my mind.<br>
I want the ladies, Mercedes, the weed and the wine.<br>
Playtime, mad money on my mind.<br>
I want the girls with the pearls, black diamonds, they shine.<br>
<br>
You will be playing-ah.<br>
You will be staying-ah.<br>
</div>

    <div class="commentary">Sexual playfulness, adult-themed adventures, interactive storytelling. A surreal seduction ritual. Rizzio turns sex into metaphor, game into myth, and rhythm into foreplay. “Playtime” is layered with dice rolls, card tricks, and numerical symbolism—“5 is my number,” “6 all night.” The imagery is sensual, the tone theatrical, and the rhythm hypnotic. Rizzio becomes both king and joker, seducing through funk and metaphor. Beneath the bravado lies a hunger for connection, control, and performance. The track is playful, provocative, and mythic—where every move is a metaphor and every metaphor is a mask.</div>

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Project X 1996,  
Also known as the PX, XP,  
You get me, get me.  

It's all about the cash this year, about the fresh cut gear, making a mint like spear.  
So stop chatting shit in my ear, like some girl you wanna chubs.  
Don't you know I get paid by the buzz, the buzz.  
Making money, money making devious designs.  
Affected like politicians, elected white-collar crime.  
Got rhetoric to put you in a spin, like a will named Catherine.  
Bully bad boys, I'm battering, scattering, not my cash.  
Collecting it like charities. Multiply styles like kids and batteries.  
Getting mass produced, you better tell the truth.  
The lion's on the fuckin' loose.

Excuse me kind sir, but my head is buzzing.  
I'm badder than your baddest cousin.  
I break you down a dime a dozen.  
Egg head cracked and scramble.  
When I boil them like vegetables in wheelchairs, they're mangled, mishandled.  
No signs of TLC, especially from me when I'm low on fuckin' money.  
Honeys getting hunches but it's all in their back sides.  
Protruding like erections when I'm digging in the sack, like the return of the mack.  
Here it is, boy I'm earning.  
Respect on the streets from the youths now they're learning.  
The weed that you're burning, a winner on the street is what an ounce is worth in.

I'm telling them from streets to stadiums,  
From the parks to palladiums,  
And Walkman stereos and radio.  
Keep your eyes on the prize of the cord and the cream, you get me.  
I'm telling them from streets to stadiums,  
From the parks to palladiums,  
And Walkman stereos and radio.  
Keep your eyes on the prize of the cord and the cream, you get me.

The life of a delinquent prevails in 1996,  
So it's time to blow up like septics in the mix.  
Stop chatting about the shit you see on TV,  
'Cause past or present, check it relates to my CV.  
Crimes with vengeance, pasta 'lam concoctions  
Making lethal lyrics brought in brain tissue. I miss you.  
Time to focus with the P times the X  
Break you back with the question mark dealings, that's when I'm vexed. Vexed.  

The limousine where I was last seen  
Stood blacker than the darkest paint in the rain.  
I refrain from creatures who lurk beneath drains.  
Deep in the back decibles creeping ever so slowly,  
Lowly at first like a river flow.  
The radio like distant thunder  
Raging like opus symphonies, tidal waves of mysticism.  
Full moons undercover in the mission.

Impossible to quarrel with the X to the P,  
Making monkeys out of MCs like PG.  
Tips to the lyricists out for the loop,  
Dressed back like a three piece suit.  

I'm telling them from streets to stadiums,  
From the parks to palladiums,  
And Walkman stereos and radio.  
Keep your eyes on the prize of the cord and the cream, you get me.

Rizzio the Rizla, rolling up the paper I've got to calat  
24 gold carats attracts attention  
And all of the sexual situations one cares not to mention.  
I'm on a midnight train to Georgia,  
I'm Gladys Knight in my plight to get in her.  
I've got fancy ball control of Eric Cantona,  
She screams the house down to the the sound of "Ooh-ah"

The back seat of my car, I'm driving Lisa round the bends,  
Dubbing MCs getting beats like a donkey in a pen.  
Signing my name in stone, like a tagger on a wall.  
Hot heads catch a fire, victims wailing from the hall.  
Hall of shame, maintain where they teach you to contest  
My style will develop like a pair of big breasts.
 
Darkness is the best part of the 24 hour  
'Cause that's when skins get peeled and I commence to devour. Devour.  
Scale six foot plus bitches, not ditches,  
As I was bred to fuck like gonorrhea catches with itches

Riches to rags in reverse,  
I protect my checks like the pharaoh's curse. 

I'm telling them from streets to stadiums,  
From the parks to palladiums,  
And Walkman stereos and radio.  
Keep your eyes on the prize with the cord and the cream, you get me.

    <div class="commentary">Romance, nightlife, lyrical dexterity, charismatic persona. A lyrical transmission from the shadows. Rizzio blends mysticism, seduction, and street wisdom into a sonic broadcast. The imagery is cinematic—limousines, moonlight, Cantona ball control—and the rhythm is smooth but eerie. “You get me” becomes a refrain of intimacy and understanding. Rizzio is both narrator and seducer, rolling Rizla paper and whispering truths. The track is layered with metaphor and mood, creating a vibe that’s both seductive and philosophical. It’s not just about sex—it’s about connection, rhythm, and mythic presence.</div>

 <div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; white-space: pre-line;">
The big five in African carnivores 
Have evolved out of that eternal struggle 
Between predator and prey
A struggle that has fitted each one of them 
For their roles in the life of death drama
They live in a harsh world...  
...where the punishment for failure...  
...is often death.

I say bangin' in the streets, you know  
So pump it in the jeeps, you know  
Get in between the sheets  
I said we're bangin' in the streets, you know  
So pump it in the jeeps, you know  
Get in between the sheets  

Bullet wounds are comin' soon  
To an area near you  
As the money's gettin' less, crack and weed—  
Indeed  
They currency are through like a click, like a clack, a coup  
Cluck, clanners run like scanners  
I'll blow out brain for true  

Magazines in my pocket, loaded lyrics, time to cock it  
Ladies like to suck it, find they flavor when I drop it  
But ____ it, where's the profit? Pimps will suss it with bros  
Rearrangin' their face like Michael Jackson's busy holes  

I'm bussin' off lyrical shots in all directions  
Turn you every which way but loose like a Western  
Rhymes are the sugar, like Tate & Lyle  
Hot as Mulder and Scully off The X-Files  
Read all about it, I got the scoop like Häagen-Dazs  
Some rappers simply red and make 'em see stars  
To Ras like an Ali shuffle 'cause we can snuff  
So watch us blow the fuck up like a NASA space shuttle  

Molecular structure is about to erupt-ah  
Like H2O above a Bunsen burner  
Steam, electrons elevate, neutrons navigate  
I'm on a wanton streak, about to devastate  
Meditate, get irate, while building Meccano  
I'm clinical and cynical like Geraldo  
Or Di Nero In the movie Cape Fear  
Huntin' you like hyenas after old deers  

Ghetto-born style, sworn to be worn  
By gold collectors, hand-spunk ejectors  
Bouncing check centers  
Guzzla size represent my nose  
Because I be the studio graphite grey GT Turbo  
Forget the basements, committing 27 foot sins  
In the bragos at the space of the bin  
Free this 0800 spank kid  
Big up to all the girls who can relate, I beg you bust a grin  

I say bangin' in the streets, you know  
So pump it in the jeeps, you know  
Get in between the sheets  
I said we're bangin' in the streets, you know  
So pump it in the jeeps, you know  
Get in between the sheets  

Order, order  
Everything I say will be on tape recorder  
But I digress  
Representers represent present  
All of my niggas, ladies and gents  
I'll knock out MPs on the iron mic  
It's just like Tyson with the right, left, right  
PX in effects in the House of Lords  
Finesse on the street-ah, Mr. Speaker!  

Stand to attention  
Troops among the microphone hunters  
Fundamental style lyrics pierce your skull  
Drill your bones like sticks and stones  
Crack your safe, close and go  
Peace, love and happiness like Al Green  
Keeps your woman sweet FA to all the punks  
If you step, I flex and pump my actions man made  
Nuclear physics blows brain damage contenders  
____ they're dismembered with radioactive lyrics  
Burning holes in golden dentures  

After grins get bust, proceed to violate  
Disease condoms, Jimmy hat connect with flap sex  
I'm at the pinnacle of my career so you best beware  
Infrared scoping, coke tokens, pockets never broken  
In the streets of the North and my style gets wicked  
Bunny pushed in prams, baby by shit weighed in grams  
Like transparent spirits your guzzla say damn  
But this is the robbery of a security van  

Thief MCs they want to nab my racks  
Because they run things like hurried goat and go cats  
In the ghetto, rough like Soweto  
Sharp as stilettos on playboy bunnies at Stringfellows  
You're a ____ hot head at your bellow  
I like my women bottom heavy  
Like bass notes on cellos  
Hello, no it's not me you're looking for  
Because I ain't Lionel Richie and this ain't the Commodore  

I say bangin' in the streets, you know  
So pump it in the jeeps, you know  
Get in between the sheets  
I said we're bangin' in the streets, you know  
So pump it in the jeeps, you know  
Get in between the sheets  

Ah, we're kicking lyrics  
We're still alive and direct  
Some little punks want to mess with me but not yet  
Because we're walking through the terror zone  
And we're not the one to mess with so leave me alone  
Because we move fast and step to the mic and just kick ass  
Give me room, give me space let the flex past  
I've got the chronic in the bag and it's the good grass  
So now you know that we don't obey the law  
You know the score, we're an outcast  
We be on the flex, never ever you trespass  
White you call the black, you call the Chinese are outcasts  
Me and my homies put your ass in a plaster cast  
And that's how we do it every day  
Don't feel no way  
The Project Hit Crew here to stay  
Better recognize  
Yeah. '96, '96, '96, '96, '96, '96...
</div>

    <div class="commentary">Street life energy, metaphorical exploration of predator/prey dynamics, musical intensity. A lyrical explosion. Rizzio blends predator-prey philosophy with scientific metaphor—“molecular structure,” “Bunsen burner,” “neutrons navigate.” The rhythm is aggressive, the tone confrontational, and the imagery primal. He’s hunting, performing, and broadcasting from the streets to the House of Lords. The repetition of “bangin’ in the streets” becomes a war cry. Rizzio is both predator and prophet, turning funk into fire. The track is chaotic, cinematic, and mythic—where every line is a strike and every strike is a statement.</div>

Ooh, the bad, rough, rugged, and rude  
Project X. You slagg  

Give me that third party firing fest  
When you're fuckin' with the P to the X  
Nonetheless, some feel they can test  
They whan big up their chest  
They gone send a letter back  
At least not at this address  
'Cause I don't need to stress  
I give 'em a chance to confess  
It was just a jest and they left  
Unless they whan fi disrespect the X  
And get phased out like Star Trek holodecks  
Who failed the test  
Now in the chapel of rest  
With the rest who messed with my sarcophagus  
Who's the apex?  
Breaking you down in the suplex  
Me whan know why you fools flex  
Because the sun don't rise in the west  
So best believe Western culture ain't what God blessed  
So I got enough stress  
Without pussyhole pests who want to step  
And get themselves debt with me vexed  
But girls not vexed  
'Cause every time I says  
Me on point like the nipples on a breast  
Making fat joints like I'm rolling up the sess  
Waiting to inhale while you're holding your breath  
I come tough like Pyrex  
Get credit like Access or American Express  
I'll make you real like Ampex  
When we blow like Semtex  
With this lyrical excess  
Fools watch me like a Rolex  
Watch your spine when me rhyme  
Because I broke necks

Wait a second, kid, hold tight, relax  
Who's he riding with? Watch him skid  
His chariot's on fire  
Start the funeral pyre  
Rest in peace, the town crier  
Snitch, liar, tree buyer  
Getting them higher  
Now his career's expired  
I never trip, never shed a tear  
Year after year  
'91 through to '92 they show me no love  
Basic Instinct said go after you to get some loot  
Fuck your security, it's my crew  
My clique, fingers twitch  
Hearts catching a stitch  
In the race to get rich quick  
Bitches should never slip on my pitch  
It's in season  
Tottenham bitches getting the heat, that's the reason  
Any fool can now bag a gun  
Dealing keys, son  
He's done now, over and out  
Heavyweight bout now, out for the count  

Yeah. 2000, that's my number  
Chop them up like cucumber  
Tasty, golden like wonder  
I rain like thunder on these mean hard streets  
I'm fuckin' lightning on my feet  
Ultraviolet, they can't see it  
God bless their crusty souls  
Niggas crying like a bitch
No way out except parole  
Just see they keep it real  
'Cause on the inside they might fold

Ooh, the bad, rough, rugged, and rude  
Project X. You slagg  

I'm cunmin' and gunning  
I guess you hear it in my rhymes  
The words that are heard  
Are so deep in the sublime  
My timing and finding lyrics that are unique  
I speak de "Le Freak" like the old band Le Chic  
My suave to party, all the nice-looking girls  
Uptown or downtown, it's all the same in my world  
So tomorrow I borrowed but I hasten to keep  
Because wining and dining always puts me to sleep  
Variety in society keeps me on point  
Beatrice and Shanice put their lips round my joint! 
Size is the prize, some say it doesn't matter  
But thin, is too slim and the girls loves it fatter!  
Roughnecks with fat cheques and the many gold plastic  
Are winners and sinners whose mission's to wax it  
This rogue loves En Vogue so I'm "Always gonna get it!"  
Bad guys in disguise, some girls may regret it  
Models are doddles and all of them bimbos  
No brain, I refrain temptations from slim hoes
Naomi my homie only in my living hell  
Like soup, watery poop in tins of Campbell  

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Ooh, the bad, rough, rugged, and rude  
Project X is the crew  
You're goin' down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Ooh, the bad, rough, rugged, and rude

    <div class="commentary">High-energy threat narrative, humorous confrontation, classic Rizzio bravado. The trilogy’s finale—Rizzio in full attack mode. The rhythm is relentless, the tone ruthless, and the persona volcanic. He mocks, seduces, and destroys with lyrical precision. “Project X” becomes his crew, his myth, his movement. The repetition of “you’re goin’ down” is both threat and prophecy. Rizzio is no longer just a player—he’s a force. The track is raw, rhythmic, and mythic—a final broadcast from the edge of swagger and survival. It’s not just a diss—it’s a declaration.</div>
